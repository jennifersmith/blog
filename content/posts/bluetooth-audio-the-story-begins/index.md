There is a narrative structure that seems somewhat familiar that would be a good match for where I am right now. I should probably point out though that I would be a character in the narrative, not the all-knowing author that has the benefit of writing either from their own imagination or from long-past historical events (which one could argue is the same thing).

The narrative structure I am referring to shows up in Bram Stoker's Dracula, where the mainly epistolary story is written from the perspectives of characters that are maybe 50% of the way through the events of the book. Lots of stuff has happened and they feel they need to start from the beginning... but little do they know there's at least 200 more pages to go so they are not done yet! 

In the same way, but maybe less dramatically, I feel the need to start at the beginning and work my way through to the present day, even though I've definitely not defeated (or even met) the monster yet. 

... Well that's all probably likely to end up on the cutting room floor isn't it. But at least I feel a bit more warmed up.


We've recently been setting up multi-room audio at home which probably is a whole post of its own if I get round to it. Anyway, as part of this we had need to engage the services of a reliable but relatively ancient UE bluetooth speaker.
