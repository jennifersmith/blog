We've recently been setting up multi-room audio at home which probably is a whole post of its own if I get round to it. Anyway, as part of this we had need to engage the services of a reliable but relatively ancient UE bluetooth speaker.

When I say reliable, I probably mean more "It's still working even though it's ten years old".
